A basic command line calculator mainly written to investigate how infix (and function call etc) parsing works.

It parses the expression passed as arguements into s-expressions, and then recursivly evaluates them

Currently supports + - * / and ^  plus brackets and  avg() and max() functions. I may add variables and user defined functions as the next step
